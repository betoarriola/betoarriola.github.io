### CPSC 120

* Lab 8

Lab 8, Part 1, was one of my favorite labs because of its content. I enjoy watching and discussing the Olympics, so the fact that there is an Olympics-based coding challenge really got my interest. I liked that the coding made us act like or pretend we were one of the judges who grade these incredible athletes for their country. What also surprised me was that I had no idea skating was an Olympic sport. This lab taught us various way to use loops for our code. I definitely learned something new from this lab.

* Lab 5

Lab 5, part 1, was one of my favorites as well. The reason I say this is that this lab taught me how to work with coding for a single file. We can break it up into pieces, making it easier to code and catch any mistakes, such as Google code styles or linting errors. I also learned how to convert integers to doubles. This lab introduced me to new functions that I had not previously used, and also introduced me to new tasks that I had not encountered before.

* Lab 6

Lab 6, part 2, was a bit challenging for me, but it did help me better understand coding and how the game works. Going into this lab, I had no idea how blackjack worked because I had never played it before. I was able to use and learn if statements and vectors to strings. This lab not only taught me more functions but also showed me how the game works and how certain cards function within the game.
